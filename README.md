+ To setup scalableMARL, follow the instruction below.

## Set up python environment for the scalableMARL repository

### Install python3.8 (if it is not already installed)
```
#to check python version
python3 -V

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3.8-dev
```

## Set up environment (conda or virtualenv)

### Set up with conda
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate scalableMARL
source setup
```
### Set up virtualenv
Python virtual environments are used to isolate package installation from the system

Replace 'virtualenv name' with your choice of folder name
```
sudo apt-get install python3-venv 

python3 -m venv --system-site-packages ./'virtualenv name'
# Activate the environment for use, any commands now will be done within this venv
source ./'virtualenv name'/bin/activate

# To deactivate (in terminal, exit out of venv), do not use during setup
deactivate
```
Now that the virtualenv is activated, you can install packages that are isolated from your system

When the venv is activated, you can now install packages and run scripts

#### Install isolated packages in your venv
```
sudo apt-get install -y eog python3-tk python3-yaml python3-pip ssh git

#This command will auto install packages from requirements.txt
pip3 install --trusted-host pypi.python.org -r requirements.txt
```

## Current workflow
### Setup repos
```
# activate env
conda activate scalableMARL
# or
source ./'virtualenv name'/bin/activate
# change directory to scalableMARL
cd ./scalableMARL
# setup repo  ***important in order to set PYTHONPATH***
source setup
```
scalableMARL repo is ready to go

### Running an algorithm
```
# its best to run from the scalableMARL folder so that logging and saving is consistent
cd ./scalableMARL
# run the alg
python3 algos/maTT/run_script.py

# you can run the alg with different argument parameters. See within run_script for more options.
# for example
python3 algos/maTT/run_script.py --seed 0 --logdir ./results/maPredPrey --epochs 40
```
### To test, evaluate, and render()
```
# for a general example 
python3 algos/maTT/run_script.py --mode test --render 1 --log_dir ./results/maTT/setTracking-v0_123456789/seed_0/ --nb_test_eps 50
# for a saved policy in saved_results
python3 algos/maTT/run_script.py --mode test --render 1 --log_dir ./saved_results/maTT/setTracking-v0_123456789/seed_0/
```
### To see training curves
```
tensorboard --logdir ./results/maTT/setTracking-v0_123456789/
```
